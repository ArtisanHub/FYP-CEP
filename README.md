# FYP-CEP
This repository contains research work conducted in applying statistical implementations, clustering techniques and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in the domain of CEP.

## Clustering
An unsupervised clustering technique is tried upon a given dataset. The technique tested is DBSCAN. 
The necessary initial parameter setting (eps and min_samples) is done in the source code and could change if necessary.

## Dynamic Time Warping
This is been used to check the similarity between two event streams. 

## Statistical Implementation
Moving Average and Moving Median is used in conducting Statistical Implementation
